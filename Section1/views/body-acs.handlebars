  Computer science involves the study of computation, automation, and information. Computer science spans theoretical disciplines (such as algorithms, theory of computation, and information theory) to practical disciplines (including the design and
  implementation of hardware and software). Computer science is generally considered an area of academic research and distinct from computer programming.
